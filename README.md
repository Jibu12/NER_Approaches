# NER_Approaches



Includes both ML based approach and Rule - based approach


1. Approach Used to Fetch and Process Data
Fetching Data:

API Utilized: Both approaches use a public news API (e.g., News API) to fetch news articles. The fetch_news_article function retrieves the latest article and extracts its content.
API Key: An API key is required for accessing the news API, which provides access to current news headlines or articles.
Processing Data:

Tokenization: Both approaches start by tokenizing the text of the article into words. Tokenization breaks down the text into individual words or tokens.
POS Tagging: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging assigns grammatical labels to each token (e.g., noun, verb).
Named Entity Recognition (NER):
SpaCy: Uses a machine learning model pre-trained on a large corpus to recognize and classify named entities (people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.).
NLTK: Uses a rule-based approach that applies predefined patterns to identify named entities based on POS tags.
2. Comparison of Results from SpaCy and NLTK
SpaCy (ML-Based Approach):

Strengths:

Accuracy: SpaCy’s machine learning model is generally more accurate in identifying entities due to its training on a large and diverse dataset.
Context Understanding: SpaCy understands the context of words and can differentiate between entities more effectively.
Variety of Entities: It can recognize a wider range of entity types, including complex and nuanced entities.
Example Output:

plaintext
Copy code
Named Entities (SpaCy):
ORG - Fox Business
GPE - US
DATE - July
NLTK (Rule-Based Approach):

Strengths:

Simplicity: NLTK’s rule-based approach is simpler and easier to understand. It uses predefined rules and patterns.
Speed: Rule-based methods can be faster to execute because they don’t require model inference.
Limitations:

Accuracy: NLTK may be less accurate, especially with more complex or less straightforward text. It can struggle with ambiguous entities and context.
Limited Entity Types: It might not recognize as many types of entities or have difficulty with less common entities.
Example Output:

plaintext
Copy code
Named Entities (NLTK):
GPE - US
ORGANIZATION - Fox Business
3. Observations and Conclusions about the Effectiveness of Each Approach
Observations:

SpaCy:

Provides more accurate and context-aware results due to its advanced machine learning model.
Can recognize a wider variety of entity types and handle more complex sentences.
Performs well with diverse and nuanced language, making it suitable for more robust NER tasks.
NLTK:

Offers a simpler and more transparent approach but may struggle with accuracy in more complex scenarios.
Limited by its reliance on predefined rules and patterns, which can miss entities or misclassify them.
Works well for straightforward tasks but may not handle nuanced language effectively.
Conclusions:

Effectiveness: SpaCy is generally more effective for real-world applications due to its advanced machine learning capabilities and ability to handle complex texts. It provides more comprehensive and accurate entity recognition.
Use Cases:
SpaCy is better suited for applications requiring high accuracy and handling diverse and complex language, such as content analysis and information extraction from large datasets.
NLTK may be sufficient for simpler tasks or when computational resources are limited, and it is also a good option for educational purposes or small-scale projects.
In summary, while both approaches can effectively extract named entities, SpaCy is preferred for its superior performance in handling diverse and complex text data.
